# HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)

It's the standard markup language for creating web pages and is used to describe their structure. An HTML consists of a series of elements, which are defined by tags, with the aim of telling the browser how to display the content.

```html
<!-- Simple exemple of an HTML file -->
<!DOCTYPE >
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Simple web page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Headline of the web page</h1>
    <p>Some paragraph to say somethig related to something</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
